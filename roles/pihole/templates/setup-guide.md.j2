# Pi-hole Setup Guide

## Access
- URL: `https://pihole.{{ target_domain }}`
- Password: (set in vault as `vault_pihole_password`)

## Post-Deployment
1. Log in to Pi-hole admin panel
2. Verify Unbound is working: Settings → DNS → Custom Upstream DNS should show `unbound#5335`
3. Point your router DHCP to use Pi-hole (`{{ target_control_ip }}`) as primary DNS
4. Verify DNSSEC: Settings → DNS → DNSSEC should be enabled

## Custom DNS Records
Managed via Ansible in `group_vars/control.yml`:
- `pihole_custom_dns_records` for A records
- `pihole_custom_cname_records` for CNAME records
